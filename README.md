# PORTA-NOC                                                        

A Wall-of-Sheep based network and monitoring solution!

We want to make this like DEFCON's wonderful Wall of Sheep, where an open/zero-trust wireless network is monitored by a log aggregator and packet analysis system.
Initially this will be splunk and moloch.
The goal is to make this network-agnostic, with the ability to install on top of a given server, connect a wireless interface, and let it set everything up with some configured parameters.
